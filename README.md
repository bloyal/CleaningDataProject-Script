*run_analysis.R* summarizes smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data collected from 30 individuals. To perform the anaylsis, make sure that the script is located in the same folder as the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder and run it as:

```
run_analysis()
```

The script will then extract the raw data from the dataset folder and export the summarized results to a file named "summarizedData.csv".
